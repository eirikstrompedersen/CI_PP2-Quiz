# PP2 - I failed


## Reasons

- Unable to figure out how I cound increment the questions porperly and return them to the DOM.
- Unable to figure out why my javascript dosn't show up in the html 


## What I've tried so far

- I've tried to increment questions by loop, with no success.
- I've also tried to increment the questions with "++", but it didn't work as intended

## Left to do
- Work out the increment function for the quiz
- Add correct answer validator
- Add score counter
- Fix design (I focused on the js code so far)
- Tidy up the code
- Write a propper readme.md
